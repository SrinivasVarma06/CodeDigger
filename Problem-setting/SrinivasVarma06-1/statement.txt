Problem's Name: "Chakra Balancing" 
Context: The Hidden Leaf Village is preparing for the ChÅ«nin Exams. 
Each ninja must balance their chakra reserves to unlock a special technique. 
You, as a skilled strategist, are tasked with ensuring the chakra levels of all ninjas 
in the squad meet specific criteria.

Problem Statement: You are given an array of integers representing the chakra levels of N ninjas in the squad. 
To maintain balance:
    1. The difference between the highest and lowest chakra levels in the squad should not exceed k.
    2. You can increase or decrease the chakra level of any ninja by 1, but each operation consumes 1 unit of chakra from a shared reserve.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to balance the squad or determine 
if it is impossible.

Input: 
The first line contains two integers N and k
N: The number of ninjas.
k: The maximum allowed difference between chakra levels.
The second line contains N integers: the initial chakra levels of the ninjas.

Output:
A single integer: the minimum number of operations needed to balance the chakra levels.
If it is impossible to balance the squad, return -1.
