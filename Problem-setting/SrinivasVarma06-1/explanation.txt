We are given n chakra levels and a range difference k.
For each possible starting chakra level (low), calculate the maximum allowed chakra level (high = low + k).

For each chakra in the list, calculate the number of operations needed to bring it into the range [low, high].
This is the absolute difference between the chakra level and the closest boundary (either low or high) and
then iterate over all possible ranges.

Try every possible valid range [low, high] (from the minimum chakra value to maxChakra - k), and for each range,
calculate the total number of operations needed and then find minimal operations.

The answer is the minimum total operations across all valid ranges.
